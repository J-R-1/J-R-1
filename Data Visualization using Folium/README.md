One of the most important tasks for someone working on datasets with countries, cities, etc. is to understand the relationships between their dataâ€™s physical location and their geographical context.  And one such way to visualize the data is using Folium since it was developed for the sole purpose of visualizing geospatial data. 

Folium builds on the data wrangling strengths of the Python ecosystem and the mapping strengths of the Leaflet.js library. Manipulate our data in Python, then visualize it in on a Leaflet map via Folium. It enables both the binding of data to a map for choropleth visualizations as well as passing Vincent/Vega visualizations as markers on the map.

Folium has a number of built-in tilesets from OpenStreetMap, Mapbox, and Stamen, and supports custom tilesets with Mapbox or Cloudmade API keys. The library also supports both GeoJSON and TopoJSON overlays, as well as the binding of data to those overlays to create choropleth maps with color-brewer color schemes.

## Data Source:

1. San Francisco Police Department Incidents for the year 2016 - Incidents derived from San Francisco Police Department (SFPD) Crime Incident Reporting system. Updated daily, showing data for the entire year of 2016. Address and location has been anonymized by moving to mid-block or to an intersection.

2. The respondents' interest in the different data science topics surveyed
