<b>Machine Learning</b> is undeniably one of the most influential and powerful technologies in todayâ€™s world. It is a tool for turning information into knowledge. Machine learning techniques are used to automatically find the valuable underlying patterns within complex data that we would otherwise struggle to discover. The hidden patterns and knowledge about a problem can be used to predict future events and perform all kinds of complex decision making.

The following is a series of <b>Kaggle Kernels</b> that demonstrates how to apply advanced Data Preprocessing and Model Validation techniques to improve the quality of the Machine learning models to building <b>state-of-the-art</b> models that are widely used to win Kaggle competitions (<b>XGBoost</b>).
