### <b> Introduction: </b>  
--------------------------
  
In a business environment today, problems such as higher competitiveness, unachievable business goals, elevated risk of unemployment can increase an employees stress levels which in time will become detrimental to his/her's health. In this project we will address the Absenteeism at a company during normal working hours. Our goal is to explore whether an Employee presenting certain characteristics is expected to be away from work at some point of time or not. Having such an information in advance can imporove an employer's decision making by reorganizing the work process which will increase the quality of work generated in a firm. 

This project focuses on <b>Python, SQL and Tableau Integration</b> as they are indespensible tools for many professionals. We will use Python for Data Preprocessing and Model Building, SQl for Quering and mending data and use Tableau for further analyses.

#### <b>Data Preprocessing:</b> 
This <a href="https://github.com/J-R-1/J-R-1/blob/main/Python-SQL-Tableau%20Integration/Absenteeism_Preprocessing.ipynb">Notebook</a> elaborates preprocessing of the raw <a href="https://github.com/J-R-1/J-R-1/blob/main/Python-SQL-Tableau%20Integration/Absenteeism-data.csv">Absenteeism</a> csv file. The steps include removing redundant features, creating dummy variables and grouping them based on their similarities, extracting meaning features from the  existing feature,etc.. The cleaned data then saved in another <a href="https://github.com/J-R-1/J-R-1/blob/main/Python-SQL-Tableau%20Integration/Absenteeism_Preprocessing.ipynb">Notebook</a>
