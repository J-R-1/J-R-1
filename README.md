# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jennifer
I am a DataScience and Machine learning enthusiast. In a day I spend a good chunk of time creating projects that includes Analyzing and Visualising data, playing around Machine learning Models trying to find which one wroks best for the data in hand. I also love gardening, cooking and reading tech articles/blogs.
