<b>Overview</b>:
<hr />

Trasfer leraning is a machine learning method where the model developed for a task is reused at a starting point for a model on a second task. The Lung disease Prediction is an application developed based on this methodology. This application given a X-ray Image file predicts 
whether an Image belongs to one of the four given classes namely BacterialPneumonia, Covid-19, Normal or ViralPneumonia.<br/>
Keras Applications provides access to a number of top-performing pre-trained models along with the pretrained weights.
This project uses three of theses models VGG16, InceptionV3 and ResNet50 for training. These models are widely used for transfer learning both because of their performance,
and also because they were examples that introduced specific architectural innovations, namely consistent and repeating structures (VGG), inception modules (GoogLeNet), and residual modules (ResNet).
